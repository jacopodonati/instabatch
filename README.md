# instabatch

Simple bash script to download Instagram pictures from several accounts with [Instalooter](https://github.com/althonos/InstaLooter). Although Instalooter has a batch mode, I've always found it cumbersome for my needs. Just put the accounts you want to download inside `accounts` and run the script. The script will make a different folder for each account. Currently, filenames will be the timestamp of publishing, but you can easily change it.
